      <h3>Cybertruck Robotic Cell Re-Design</h3>
      <p class="meta">Role: Equipment Engineering Intern @ Tesla</p>
      
      <p>
        <strong>Problem:</strong> A key robotic cell on the Cybertruck production line was improperly disposing of rejected seat structures, dropping them on the floor. This resulted in hundreds of thousands of dollars in annual material scrap, frequent production downtime for manual retrieval, and created a safety hazard for associates entering the cell.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>My Solution:</strong> As the sole owner of this project, I engineered a complete mechanical and robotics solution. I designed a custom, non-intrusive rejection chute from the ground up using Solidworks and Siemens NX, ensuring it integrated seamlessly into the existing cell's tight footprint. I then single-handedly reprogrammed the entire Fanuc robotic logic, rewriting the pathing to flawlessly deposit rejected parts into the new assembly.
      </T>
      <p>
        <strong>Results:</strong> I drove the project through the full lifecycle, leading a cross-functional team of stakeholders from manufacturing, compliance, and testing to successfully implement my design. The solution completely eliminated the scrap issue and associated downtime, **delivering an annual savings of hundreds of thousands of dollars** while improving cell safety and maintaining the original workflow for production associates.

      <h3>Advanced System Integration Lead</h3>
      <p class="meta">Role: Mechanical Design TPM Intern @ Lockheed Martin</p>
      
      <p>
        <strong>Problem:</strong> Tasked as the integration lead for a proprietary, mission-critical system on the CSC, I was responsible for navigating conflicting constraints from three external vendors and internal RF, electrical, and mechanical design teams. The challenge was to find a viable integration path that did not compromise system performance, ship layout, or classified design integrity.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>My Solution:</strong> I took extreme ownership of the project, serving as the single point of contact for all 3 vendors and our internal cross-functional teams. I personally drove the technical design, using my mechanical background to model and propose design changes in SolidWorks to resolve physical, thermal, and RF constraints. My key responsibility was to distill highly technical, classified system requirements from a secure lab into actionable, unclassified design and manufacturing tasks for vendors, ensuring they could execute their scope without compromising project security.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Results:</strong> By proactively managing scope, schedule, and complex technical trades, I successfully aligned all stakeholders on a final, approved integration path. This cleared a major bottleneck for a critical program milestone, and my role as the bridge between technical engineering, vendor management, and program leadership ensured the project remained on schedule and met all system requirements.

        <h3>CSC Topside Equipment Relocation & Integration</h3>
        <p class="meta">Role: Mechanical Design TPM Intern @ Lockheed Martin</p>
        
        <p>
            <strong>Problem:</strong> Integrating and relocating critical equipment on the Canadian Surface Combatant (CSC) topside required balancing numerous competing technical constraints, including RF interference, aerodynamic impacts, thermal loads, vendor specifications, and existing structural limitations. Finding feasible locations acceptable to all stakeholders was essential to avoid program delays.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>My Solution:</strong> As the lead for several topside design initiatives, I drove the cross-functional effort to find optimal equipment placements. I collaborated directly with internal RF, Aerodynamic, and Thermal analysis teams, along with multiple equipment vendors, to define all constraints. I then developed detailed feasibility studies in SolidWorks, modeling various placement options and evaluating the technical trade-offs for each. Finally, I presented these studies and my recommended solutions to senior management.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Results:</strong> Within 4 months, I successfully spearheaded **7 critical equipment placement proposals** from initial feasibility analysis through to final management approval for implementation. My role involved synthesizing complex technical data, managing stakeholder input, and driving decisions, ensuring the optimal balance of performance and integration feasibility while keeping the program on schedule.

      <h3>Helicopter Landing Thermal Analysis (CFD)</h3>
      <p class="meta">Role: Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) Intern @ Lockheed Martin</p>

      <p>
        <strong>Problem:</strong> The Canadian Surface Combatant (CSC) program needed to validate safe helicopter landing conditions, but it was unknown how hot turbine exhaust would affect the flight deck under dozens of different headwind angles, engine throttles, and outtake arrangements. The team lacked the critical thermal data required for these RANS simulations.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>My Solution:</strong> I developed the foundational thermodynamic model to solve this problem. I first calculated the previously unknown engine exhaust mass flow rates and temperatures for all required scenarios. Using this data, I developed, meshed, and analyzed the full set of 28 CFD simulations in ANSYS Fluent, modeling all combinations of headwind angles and engine uptake conditions.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Results:</strong> My simulations generated 28 thermal contour maps showing the maximum temperature over the flight deck for every possible condition. I consolidated this complex data into a single, concise 'logic board' that was delivered to vendors, enabling them to validate safe helicopter landing envelopes for the multi-billion dollar program.

      <h3>Company-Wide Line-of-Sight (LOS) Process Overhaul</h3>
      <p class="meta">Role: Mechanical Design Engineering Intern @ Lockheed Martin</p>

      <p>
        <strong>Problem:</strong> The existing company procedure for conducting line-of-sight (LOS) analysis for critical topside equipment on the Canadian Surface Combatant (CSC) program contained significant discrepancies, leading to extremely inaccurate results and potential rework.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>My Solution:</strong> After identifying the root cause of the errors, I led the complete redevelopment of a new, more accurate LOS analysis procedure using SolidWorks. I created all documentation for the new standard and personally trained other engineers on its proper implementation to ensure company-wide adoption.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Results:</strong> The new procedure I developed was formally adopted and **improved process accuracy by over 8%**. This enhancement reduced the risk of costly design flaws and is now the standard method used for the multi-billion dollar CSC program.

      <h3>Production Line Data Automation</h3>
      <p class="meta">Role: Aerospace Engineering Intern @ RTX (Pratt & Whitney)</p>
    
      <p>
        <strong>Problem:</strong> Strategic decisions for optimizing the PW800 production line were dependent on a highly inefficient, manual data-pulling process. Multiple times a year, three engineers would spend two full days (a 48 person-hour task) manually extracting and formatting live turbine blade data from SAP, a process that was both slow and prone to human error.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>My Solution:</strong> Tasked as one of the manual headcounts, I instead took the initiative to single-handedly engineer a permanent automated solution. I developed a complex Visual Basic script that interfaces directly with SAP, loops through hundreds of processes, and automatically transforms the raw data. The script features robust error handling and outputs a concise, executive-ready spreadsheet for immediate analysis.
      </T>
      <p>
        <strong>Results:</strong> My script completely **eliminated the 48 person-hour manual process**, saving hundreds of engineering hours annually and significantly increasing data accuracy. The solution was resiliency-tested and implemented as the new company standard. The report I automated now serves as the baseline for all strategic optimization decisions, and I created clear documentation for any engineer to use and maintain it going forward.
